About

This repository contains all my JavaScript learning materials, including:

Practice problems and solutions.

Code snippets.

Notes on JavaScript concepts.

Helpful resources (tutorials, articles, etc.).


My learning goals for JavaScript:

1. Understand basic syntax: variables, functions, loops, and conditionals.


2. Learn how to manipulate the DOM.


3. Understand JavaScript objects, arrays, and functions at a deeper level.


4. Build small projects to practice (like a calculator or a to-do app).


5. Familiarize myself with ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, promises, etc.
